Installation To install the packages in this repository you can use the Wally package manager. After installing Wally, navigate to your project directory and run wally init – this will generate the wally.toml file. You can add the roblox-utility modules to the generated wally.toml file as dependencies. After adding the modules to your dependecy list, run wally install. Wally will subsequently generate a Packages folder in your project directory which will contain the installed dependencies.","keywords":""},{"title":"NetworkRequest","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/roblox-utility/api/NetworkRequest","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Types​","type":1,"pageTitle":"NetworkRequest","url":"/roblox-utility/api/NetworkRequest#types","content":" "},{"title":"Self​","type":1,"pageTitle":"NetworkRequest","url":"/roblox-utility/api/NetworkRequest#Self","content":"&lt;/&gt; type Self = NetworkRequest   "},{"title":"Event​","type":1,"pageTitle":"NetworkRequest","url":"/roblox-utility/api/NetworkRequest#Event","content":"&lt;/&gt; interface Event { connect: ( self: Event, callback: (...any) → () ) → EventConnection } An interface that respresents an event that can be connected to  "},{"title":"EventConnection​","type":1,"pageTitle":"NetworkRequest","url":"/roblox-utility/api/NetworkRequest#EventConnection","content":"&lt;/&gt; interface EventConnection { connected: boolean disconnect: (self: EventConnection) → () } An interface that respresents a connection to an event.

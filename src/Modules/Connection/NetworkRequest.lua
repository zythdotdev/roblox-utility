--[=[
	@class NetworkRequest

	An object that wraps Roblox's remote function. It can be used to request data from the server and receive a response on the client
	without having to manage remote function instance lifecycles manually â€“ initialization and deinitialization are handled for you

	:::note
	Network requests are intended to be paired. A `NetworkRequest` object should be initialized on the server first and then on the client,
	otherwise, an error will occur. The server `NetworkRequest` object will destroy the underlying Roblox `RemoteFunction` instance when it is
	destroyed. Attempting to call a method on a `NetworkRequest` after its server-side counterpart has been destroyed will result in an error. This
	can be monitored via the `NetworkRequest.remoteFunctionDestroyed` event

	Any type of Roblox object such as an `Enum`, `Instance`, or others can be passed as a parameter when a `NetworkRequest` is fired,
	as well as Luau types such as `number`, `string`, and `boolean`. `NetworkRequest` shares its limitations with Roblox's `RemoteFunction` class

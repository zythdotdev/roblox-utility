# Roblox Utility

A collection of utility modules that can be used to enhance your Roblox game development experience.

# Installation

To install the packages in this repository you can use the Wally package manager. After installing Wally, navigate to your project directory and run `wally init` â€“ this will generate the `wally.toml` file. You can add the `roblox-utility` modules to the generated `wally.toml` file as dependencies. After adding the modules to your dependecy list, run `wally install`. Wally will subsequently generate a `Packages` folder in your project directory which will contain the installed dependencies.

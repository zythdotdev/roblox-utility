Installation To install the packages in this repository you can use the Wally package manager. After installing Wally, navigate to your project directory and run wally init – this will generate the wally.toml file. You can add the roblox-utility modules to the generated wally.toml file as dependencies. After adding the modules to your dependecy list, run wally install. Wally will subsequently generate a Packages folder in your project directory which will contain the installed dependencies.","keywords":""},{"title":"EventConnection","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/roblox-utility/api/EventConnection","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Properties​","type":1,"pageTitle":"EventConnection","url":"/roblox-utility/api/EventConnection#properties","content":" "},{"title":"className​","type":1,"pageTitle":"EventConnection","url":"/roblox-utility/api/EventConnection#className","content":"Static &lt;/&gt; EventConnection.className: string Static property that defines the class name of the EventConnection object "},{"title":"Functions​","type":1,"pageTitle":"EventConnection","url":"/roblox-utility/api/EventConnection#functions","content":" "},{"title":"new​","type":1,"pageTitle":"EventConnection","url":"/roblox-utility/api/EventConnection#new","content":"Static &lt;/&gt; EventConnection.new( event: Event,-- An event to connect to node: Node-- A node representing the callback in the event's linked list ) → EventConnection-- The EventConnection object Constructs a new EventConnection object caution Do not construct this object manually.
